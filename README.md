I started this bot because I have several facets I need covered for Book Club. They are as follows;

1. Voting
{
Voting works, as of today, in a rudimentary way. SUBMITTER submits TWO (2) BOOKs. Remaining USERS vote between the two books. USERS can only vote one or the other, it is a binary choice. Whichever BOOK receives the majority of votes gets added to bookLIST. I want this system automated so that two facets occur.
    A.) USERS can't accidentally vote twice.
    B.) SUBMITTERs don't have to format their books (as they currently have to individually submit each book)
If both of these facets are secured then everything moves more smoothly in the bookLIST generation.    
}
    
2. List Generation
After every USER has voted on every BOOK such that the bookLIST is built out, the bookLIST is then randomized. I also want this automated so no one wonders if the list is biased, and I also want it displayed in a clean, even, easy to read way.
